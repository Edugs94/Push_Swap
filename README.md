# ⚙️ Push Swap Project Summary

Here is a summary of the workflow for my **Push Swap** project, designed for the **42 school** curriculum. This project focuses on sorting an unsorted list of random integers using highly restricted operations between two stacks.

---

## 📚 Objective & Constraints

The main goal is to sort a list of random numbers from **minimum to maximum values** using only two data structures, **Stack A** and **Stack B**, and a limited set of allowed movements.

The **allowed movements** are:

* **Swap:** `sa`, `sb`, `ss`
* **Push:** `pa`, `pb`
* **Rotate:** `ra`, `rb`, `rr`
* **Reverse Rotate:** `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`

## 🧠 Algorithm & Efficiency

#### Chosen Algorithm: **Turk Sort**

The sorting strategy implemented is the **Turk Algorithm**. 
The detailed steps followed for this implementation are based on the guidance provided in the article below:

#### Performance 📈

Most of the time, this **Turk algorithm** completes the task for **500 random numbers** using **under 5500 moves**, demonstrating strong performance relative to the project requirements.
